Let's Travel! Valorant Agents

## Description

There are 23 Valorant Agents. Each agent is unique in its own way. Specifically want to focus on their ethnicity. Main page can have multiple buttons each designated to the agent that takes user into the agents information. 

Design each agents page to implement their culture to make it fun.

    But rather game sense focused - more about getting to know the agents themselves. (maybe?)
